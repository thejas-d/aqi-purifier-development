🌏 Air Purifier Product–Market Fit Research using AQI Analytics
📌 Project Overview
This project combines Air Quality Index (AQI) analytics, health impact data, EV adoption trends, and population statistics to identify product–market fit opportunities for launching an air purifier product in India.

Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I analyzed large datasets to uncover target markets, pollutant profiles, seasonal trends, and competitive insights — enabling data-driven product development and go-to-market strategy.

🎯 Objectives
Identify high AQI regions for targeted market entry

Determine most common pollutants by region to design optimized filter configurations

Understand seasonal and weekly air quality patterns for demand forecasting

Map public health outcomes to air pollution exposure

Benchmark major competitors to identify key differentiators

📊 Data Sources
aqi.csv → Historical Air Quality Index data with pollutant composition

idsp.csv → Integrated Disease Surveillance Program data (health impacts)

vahan.csv → Vehicle registration & EV adoption statistics

population_projection.csv → City-wise population estimates for 2024

🔍 Key Analyses Performed
1️⃣ Market Prioritization
Top 5 most polluted cities and bottom 5 cleanest cities (Dec 2024 – May 2025)

State-level AQI patterns from 2022 onwards

2️⃣ Pollutant Profiling
Top 2 & Bottom 2 prominent pollutants in Southern states

Regional pollutant variations for custom filter design

3️⃣ Temporal Patterns
Worst months for air quality across top 10 states

Weekend vs weekday AQI in metro cities

4️⃣ Public Health Impact
Top 2 reported illnesses per state and their AQI correlation

Age-group-based disease classification (Children, Young Adult, Adult, Elderly)

5️⃣ EV Adoption vs AQI
Compared AQI in high EV adoption states vs low adoption states

6️⃣ Competitor Benchmarking
Studied Daikin, Eureka Forbes, Cuckoo, Sharp on:

Price positioning

Filtration stages

Smart features (IoT, app integration)

🛠 Tech Stack
SQL – Data querying and transformation

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Data processing & visualization

Power BI – Dashboard design for top-level management

Excel – Quick calculations & data checks

📈 Insights for Product–Market Fit
High AQI cities (Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru) are ideal launch markets

Southern states require region-specific filter combinations (e.g., PM2.5 + O₃-heavy filters)

Demand peaks in Oct–Jan; production cycles should match

Target children & elderly-focused marketing due to higher vulnerability

Adding real-time AQI monitoring as a product feature can increase value proposition
