#**Air Purifier Product–Market Fit Analysis**

Codebasics Resume Project Challenge #16 – Sponsored by Dataful

##📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes India’s air quality patterns and their public health impacts to identify high-potential markets for air purifier development.
Using multiple datasets (AQI, health surveillance, EV adoption, population projections), I applied data analytics and visualization techniques to produce actionable product strategy insights.

The analysis aims to:

Pinpoint launch geographies with the highest need for air purifiers.

Profile regional pollutants to recommend optimal filter designs.

Map seasonal and weekly pollution patterns for marketing & inventory planning.

Link health trends to pollution for product features targeting vulnerable populations.

🗂 Datasets Used
Dataset	Description	Rows
AQI Data	Air quality measurements across India	235,785
VAHAN Data	EV adoption and registration trends	64,841
IDSP Data	Health surveillance (reported illnesses)	6,474
Population Projection	Population estimates by city/state	8,892

##🛠 Tools & Technologies

Data Analysis: SQL, Excel, Power Query

Visualization: Power BI, DAX

Data Processing: Data Cleaning, ETL, Data Modeling

Additional Research: Market & Competitor Benchmarking

##📊 Key Insights

1️⃣ High-Priority Target Markets – Cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru rank in the highest AQI category, ideal for early market penetration.
2️⃣ Regional Pollutant Profiling – Southern states show different pollutant compositions (PM2.5 vs O₃ dominance), requiring customized filter configurations.
3️⃣ Seasonal & Weekly Trends – Pollution peaks between October–January; weekdays vs weekends show measurable variation.
4️⃣ Health Impact Mapping – Correlation between pollution spikes and illnesses affecting children & elderly.
5️⃣ Competitive Benchmarking – Brands like Daikin, Eureka Forbes, Cuckoo, Sharp studied for pricing, filtration stages, and smart features.

##💡 Business Recommendations

Regional Product Variants → Filters optimized for local pollutant mix.

Targeted Marketing Campaigns → Messaging linked to local health risks.

Market Entry Prioritization → Focus on high AQI + high population density cities.

Smart Features → Bundle real-time AQI monitoring with purifiers.

##📈 Outcome & Next Steps

The research forms a data-backed roadmap for product managers, investors, and marketing teams.

Next Phase: Develop a Power BI dashboard integrating AQI analytics with sales projections, competitor pricing, and consumer segmentation.
